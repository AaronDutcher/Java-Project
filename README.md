# Memory Tester


This is my finals Project for my Java class.

This is a game a skills test to see how well you can remember where the letters are.
Ive made it a little difficult so you would have to really think and remember where 
you last saw the letter.

# How it works:
The game is very simple to do but a litte difficult to beat.
All you have to do is start clicking on the tile and you will 
see a letter pop up. Now all you have to do is try and find its matching tile.
there are 28 pairs so it wont be just a walkin the park. once you beat get all 
the correct matches then you have won.

3. If you are useing a Mac then you have to extract the MemoryTester folder and then copy the path
